Integrated Capstone Project: Healthcare Patient Prognosis Prediction
Project Overview

This capstone project simulates a real-world healthcare scenario where data-driven insights can improve patient care and hospital efficiency. The goal is to develop an AI-powered system capable of predicting patient outcomes, such as the risk of appointment no-shows, length of stay, and response to treatments.

The project integrates skills from five IBM certificates—from data acquisition and cleaning to advanced machine learning and AI deployment.

Dataset

Medical Appointment No Shows – Kaggle Dataset Link

This real-world dataset contains patient and appointment information, making it ideal for:

Initial data exploration and cleaning

Building predictive models

Deploying AI applications for actionable insights
