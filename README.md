# Machine Learning Experiments

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repo is a growing collection of projects, experiments, and learning exercises as I continue to develop my skills in Python, machine learning, and data analysis.  

## Purpose of this Repository
I created this repo to:

- Document my journey learning machine learning and Python programming.
- Experiment with different algorithms, datasets, and visualization techniques.
- Build projects that have practical applications, from data analysis to predictive modeling.
- Serve as a portfolio to showcase my understanding of ML concepts and coding practices.

## What You Will Find Here
This repository contains:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code, visualizations, and explanations for each project.
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used for experiments and model training/testing.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data processing, model building, and analysis.
- **Documentation**: READMEs and notes explaining the goals, methodology, and learnings from each project.

## Learning Goals
Through this repository, I aim to:

- Strengthen my understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Learn how to preprocess and analyze data efficiently.
- Master model evaluation, visualization, and interpretation.
- Understand how real-world data (e.g., health, finance, or business datasets) can be analyzed to derive actionable insights.

## How to Use This Repository
You can explore the projects in this repo by opening the notebooks, running the Python scripts, or reviewing the visualizations and notes. Each folder generally corresponds to a specific project or experiment.

## About Me
I am an aspiring AI and Python developer with a background in business management and analytics. My goal is to combine technical expertise with real-world experience to create impactful solutions and learn cutting-edge AI techniques.
